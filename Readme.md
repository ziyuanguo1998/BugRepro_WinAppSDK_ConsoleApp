###General
This example is showing an unpackaged + non windows self-contain app to use the most simple Phi Silica API in WinAppSDK 1.7 Experimental3.
Given my machine is ARM, if have Intel x64 one, simple change can be made but below doesn't specify the details.

##Prerequisites
1. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/apis/phi-silica#prerequisites
2. Given it is unpackaged app, we need to install the runtime.
Install the ARM64 version of WinAppSDK 1.7 Experimental 3 from here https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/downloads#windows-app-sdk-17-experimental
So far the download link is https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.7/1.7.250127003-experimental3/windowsappruntimeinstall-arm64.exe
3. This is .net 9 as example, thus ensure you have VS2022 and .net9 installed.

##Steps
Just open the ConsoleApp.sln by VS2022, and Press Debug to go !
